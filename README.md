# Competitive

This repo will consist of all the coding questions from various sites like leetcode, codechef, edyst, and others.
Most of the questions are implementation based or ad-hoc while greedy and dynamic programming questions keep coming in.
Please feel free to make changes to existing code or contribute new questions.

Note: All solutions are in Python only.

## 30Day LeetCode Challenge

Solutions to daily challenge questions on LC.


## CodeChef

Solutions to practice and challenge questions on CodeChef

## Edyst

Solutions of most questions on the edyst platform for the Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures course

## Geeks4Geeks

Random and interesting problems on G4G 

## InterviewCake

Notes and Solutions to questions from probably the best website to develop algorithmic thinking

## LeetCode

LeetCode grind

## Others

Random questions that I felt were important or trash files to check if the function works or not

## Soring Algorithms

Famous sorting algorithms in Python

## Talentio

Getting familiar with coding interview questions with Talentio

## HackWithInfyMock

Questions and solutions of HWI mock tests

## Techniques

This will contain algorithms/techniques that help reduce time complexity of our programs

### Two bibles of coding interviews
1. Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI)
2. Programming Interview Exposed (PEI)

## Tips to Consider

```
If input array is sorted then
    - Binary search
    - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
    - Backtracking

If given a tree then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a graph then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a linked list then
    - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
    - Stack

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
    - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
    - Heap

If asked for common strings then
    - Map
    - Trie

Else
    - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
    - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
```
