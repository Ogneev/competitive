Okay, so this is my notes from the Editors class of the missing-semester course
I think it is worth mentioning that I am using the vim editor to write this
It takes time to get used to these commands, but I can already see how helpful and 
productive it is going to be.


def yo_mama(limit):
    for i in range(1, limit):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            print("Yo mama", end=" ")
        if i % 5 == 0:
            print("so fat", end=" ")
        if i % 3 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("her car has stretch marks")
def main():
    yo_mama(10)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

The above lines of code, I first wrote them out, just like I would in Pycharm or VS Code,
but then I edited them using vim commands. Some of them are:
1. I used G to go to the bottom of the present page, and I used gg to get to the starting
2. I used the /(word) command a lot to navigate my cursor to the first occurance of that word
3. I used ci( a lot, because I had three print functions in my code, and I used ci( to change
everything inside them. ci( standing for change in parenthesis
4. I also used $ a lot to get to the end of the line (trivial)
5. I used the j and k a lot to move down and up between the lines
6. I also used the . facility that just replicates the last edit that you've done.
   As you can observe, my first 2 print statements have the end argument in them, and
   I obviously didn't want to write them again and again. So I did the change in the first 
   print function, and then I went two lines down using k and then k. And then I just did .
  Voila!


That's about it for today's vim session and I am looking forward to get onto vimgolf and have a lot of
fun there! 
P.S: I don't know how to get rid of the highlighted print words, they have been so since I used
the /print command to search for the print statement in my code. Let me know how to do that!
